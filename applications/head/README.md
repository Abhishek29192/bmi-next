## Update DAST context files

There are certain fields that aren't in plain text and aren't obvious what they do. The _easiest_ way to update the context file is:

1. Download [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)
1. Import context to update
1. Make changes
1. Test changes
   1. Run spider
   1. Run active scan
1. Export context
