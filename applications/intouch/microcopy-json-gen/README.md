# InTouch microcopy JSON files generator
:memo: **Note:** For the time being, there is no automation of the process of creating, saving and applying updates to microcopy JSON files for the `frontend` service. Such automation will be configured in the future with help of Gitlab CI/CD.

## Switch to a new Git feature branch
First of all, not to affect the `master` branch we have to move to a separate feature branch, e.g.
```bash
git checkout -b intouch/IRP-XYZ-update-microcopy
```

## Download XLSX file
Then we should download and save locally in this working directory the file [Microcopy source of truth.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTmem2eiKjjzUZVG4vGjxF3akDBkg6dlGx9G505pZYo/edit#gid=1526622286).
<br>
Please ask [Chris Phippen](mailto:chris.phippen@bmigroup.com) to share this file if you don't have access.

## Run the JSON files generator
After that, we can run a Python script that generates JSON microcopy files for the front end service.
<br>
To do this run the following sequence of commands (it's assumed that we are executing these commands in the bash in Linux or WSL).

- Install Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv virt-env
```

- Activate virtual environment
```bash
source virt-env/bin/activate
```

- Install required modules
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To check the usage of the script we can run the Python script with the help option
```bash
python3 generate_microcopy_json.py --help
```

- To run a script with default arguments simply run this:
```bash
python3 generate_microcopy_json.py
```

- Deactivate virtual environment if run script completes successfully
```bash
deactivate
```

:memo: **Note:** The processing of Auth0 translations has been intentionally excluded from the Python script. Such processing will be added in the future.

## Save generated JSON files
When the script finishes executing we will get a directory with JSON files.
```bash
ls -ah

.  ..  da_DK  de_DE  en_EN  en_MY  en_UK  es_ES  fi_FI  it_IT  nb_NO  pl_PL  pt_PT  sv_SE
```

We can compare the received files with the existing ones if we want to know what has been changed.
```bash
diff -qr locales ../frontend/public/locales
```

If everything suits us we can copy the locales directory over the existing one.
```bash
cp -vr locales ../frontend/public/locales
```

Then we can prepare an appropriate merge request.
