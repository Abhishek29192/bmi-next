# Components

## Workbench

We are using [React Stylesguidist](https://github.com/SaraVieira/react-styleguidist) to generate the workbench to build UI components quickly.

To install React Styleguidist

```shell
$ yarn workbench
```

## Creating a new component

To create a new component package, use a lowercase hyphenated name and run:

```shell
$ yarn create-component [component-name]
```
