### Newsletter

At the moment, this is the only case where the `InputBanner` has been used.

```jsx
<InputBanner
  title="Sign up for our newsletter"
  description="Get the very latest roofing news, tips, product information and innovations directly from BMI straight to your inbox."
  inputLabel="Email address"
  inputCallToAction="Sign up"
/>
```
