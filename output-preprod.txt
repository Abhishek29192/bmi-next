[2K[1A[2K[GExported queries are only executed for Page components. It's possible you're
trying to create pages in your gatsby-node.js and that's failing for some
reason.

If the failing component(s) is a regular component and not intended to be a page
component, you generally want to use a <StaticQuery>
(https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query)
instead of exporting a page query.

If you're more experienced with GraphQL, you can also export GraphQL
fragments from components and compose the fragments in the Page component
query and pass data down into the child component —

[2K[1A[2K[Gwarn Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env
config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the
 "loose" mode option was set to "true" for
@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties,
 @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and
@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you
can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[2K[1A[2K[Gwarn Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env
config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the
 "loose" mode option was set to "true" for
@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties,
 @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and
@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you
can silence this warning by explicitly adding

to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.
